# E-commerce-Website-Project

The aim of that project conducted during my 3rd year of my Bachelor's in France was to create an e-commerce website on our own using only technologies like HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, Ajax, and Javascript.

Because I did it in France everything is french. To navigate the site, don't hesitate to download all the files and remember to import the SQL files into phpmyadmin and then enjoy!
